|------------------------------|-------|
| Code Deliverable             |  50   |
| Documentation                |  25   |
| Presentation                 |  25   |
|  __Total__                   |  100  |

As a reminder this project forms 20% of your final grade. The work you turn in should reflect this.

## Motivation
The goal of the final project is to show off what you have learned through the year. Rather than give a final exam, I would rather see your ability expressed through accomplishing a goal using code. This document outlines the basics for the project and how it will be delivered, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond. Work beyond what is expected will be recognized and __extra points will be awarded__.

## General Requirements
For this project you are going to be answering some question using simulation. Think to the Airplane boarding example we watched earlier in the year. You are welcome to think problem first, or simulation first. Either way is fine with me, as long as you are not 'just simulating for fun.' __There must be some output, some measurable outcome.__  

This project must utilize good and appropriate:
* classes
* data structures
* algorithm design

This project may be completed as a group of two. If you are working in a group, the expectation is that the overall effort will reflect such. All code will be written utilizing pair programming, utilizing whatever appropriate tools (like the Live Share extension). This means that both group members will be actively engaged when code is being worked on. The rest of the work should be evenly divided among the group and all group members should review all work before submitting it.

If you want to work as a group, email/message Scott __before__ 4/26/2020. He will set up a group repository on Whitgit. Please use that repository for submission.

All artifacts, with the exception of the individual feedback sent via email, will be submitted via this Whitgit repository. For non-code things you are welcome and encouraged to submit links instead of uploading. This includes presentation material, code documentation and design material. Just make sure access settings are correctly set. If I cannot get to it, I cannot grade it! 

## Project Proposal (optional)
After some brainstorming, you can submit a project proposal for review. This is not required, but highly suggested. I will review your plan and give you a thumbs up, or a suggestion of how to make the project either more rigorous (the solution would be too easy) or how to re-frame the problem to make is easier to solve (your planned solution is too difficult for this level class).

You don't want to be the person that I have to tell after that their work is not sufficient for the class. That stinks for me and it will stink for you.

These proposals need to be submitted __before__ Friday 5/1/2020.

## Deliverables

### Documentation
You will submit a document (.md, .docx, .pdf) in this repository that contains the following:
* Detailed description of the problem this project attempts to solve and/or a detailed purpose statement.
* Clear and Detailed Requirements for the project. This should directly trace to your Classes and Functions.
* Clear overview of the simulation and how all of the different elements work.
* A detailed report and analysis of your findings.
* Detailed use case and manual for how to run your project.
* Works Cited. This includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should be mirrored in your code.

Your code must be appropriately commented. This includes headers for every method/function and file headers.

As a note, detailed means: "having many details or facts; showing attention to detail". This means that I should have _zero_ questions about what you did, how you did it and why. Look at how long this document is. This is just the documentation for the framework of the project. Take that into consideration when developing your documentation.

__If working in a group__: each group member will email me (sgriffith@whitworth.edu) on the Friday of finals week an individual and confidential reflection of how the project went with a review of their group member. This will be worth 5% of your overall project grade. You should answer the following in this email:
* How did the project go? What went well? What would you do differently?
* How was the project split? How did the pair programming work?
* Would you work with your group partner again? Were there any issues?

### Presentation
In place of in-person presentations, each project will have a presentation that can be enjoyed asynchronously. This could take the form of a YouTube video, webpage/blog or a podcast. I don't really care the form, what I care about is that your presentation fully details the work you did. 

Your presentation should:
* Be accessible by everyone in class (no platform specific log-ins / installs)
* outline your project and what conclusions you made
* highlight the main points of your simulation
* include a demonstration, but only if it aids in understanding
* clearly identify the path forward for the project
* identify major problems that were encountered and how you overcame them
* take 5 minutes. Be careful with your time

Your presentation should not:
* be a code review. Selections of code is fine, but we don't need to see every line of code. We want to see results!

Each individual/group will need to email me a link to their presentation by __Thursday 5/14/2020 by 3:30PM PST__. I will put together a list of all of the projects for the class to review.

Everyone will need to submit their own, individual, __project review document__. This will come in the form of a Whitgit project. Each person wil need to participate in the rest of the project presentations. This review will be 10% of your presentation grade. You will have from Thursday 5/14/2020, 3:31PM to Saturday 5/16/2020, 8AM PST to review your classmates' projects. More details on this will be pushed out closer to the final presentation date.

Make sure all group members participate in the presentation.

### Project Implementation
As with all code turned in for this class, the same rules apply here for this final project.  

You will be graded on proper coding style. Your code must be readable and have good comments describing what is going on. Variable names should make sense, classes and their methods should be obvious, and variables should be descriptive. Use proper indentation.  

At this point in your CS career you should be able to take advantage proper code re-use and functionalization. Each function should only do one thing. If it is doing many things, those should be functionalized. Remember you have the power of templates too.  

Your code should line up with your documentation. All citations should be clearly marked and identified.
